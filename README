Engine_cudamrg Quickstart
-------------------

In order to generate a makefile you have to call configure first. 
./configure

You might have to supply configure with the path to your CUDA toolkit:
./configure --with-cudatoolkitpath=/opt/cuda

If you know what NVIDIA device engine-cuda will run on, you can use the -arch
flag to tailor nvcc-compilation:
NVCFLAGS="-arch sm_11" ./configure

After that simply do

make
make install

For any further information please refer to http://code.google.com/p/engine-cuda/
