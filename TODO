== General ==

- Test-Framework for single-file encryption with averaging

- Try out write-combining with page locked memory and two different staging areas?
 
- Why does speed decrease after 1MB / 256KB
 - Try OpenSSL compiled with 1MB encrypt block size
- Non-blocking kernel calls?
- Many calls to CudaMemcpy, where from?
- Adjust buffersize to device memory

- Sboxes use large data types

== OpenCL ==
- Use constant memory for BF

== DES ==
- CBC
- Does constant memory get copied on every invocation? (Constant mem DES for IDEA-ECB for example)
 - Better to use dynamic texture memory, which is cached as well
- warp serializing / gst uncoalesced (CUDA profiler): bank conflicts. shared memory or texture memory?
- warp serializing also on s (round key)
- des_SP into texture memory (or shared memory) because access to it is _never_ coalesced?

== BF ==

== IDEA ==

== Camellia ==
- Try shared instead of constant memory, as usual

== CAST ==
- Occupancy limited by huge S-Tables
