== General ==
- PTX inline?
- Non-blocking kernel calls?
- Many calls to CudaMemcpy, where from?
- Adjust buffersize to device memory
- cuPrintf inclusion OK?
- Streams
- Rambo is capped at 800MB/s, why?


== DES ==
- CBC
- Does constant memory get copied on every invocation? (Constant mem DES for IDEA-ECB for example)
 - Better to use dynamic texture memory, which is cached as well
- Same memory for in and out?
- warp serializing / gst uncoalesced (CUDA profiler): bank conflicts. shared memory or texture memory?
- warp serializing also on s (round key)
- des_SP into texture memory (or shared memory) because access to it is _never_ coalesced?

== BF ==

== IDEA ==
- Bring down register use to increase occupancy

== Camellia ==
- Try shared instead of constant memory, as usual

== CAST ==
- Occupancy limited by huge S-Tables
