== General ==
- Testing framework
- Non-blocking kernel calls?
- Many calls to CudaMemcpy, where from?
- Single Init / Finish for CUDA
- Adjust buffersize to device memory

== DES ==
- CBC
- Same memory for in and out?
- warp serializing / gst uncoalesced (CUDA profiler): bank conflicts. shared memory or texture memory?
- warp serializing also on s (round key)
- des_SP into texture memory (or shared memory) because access to it is _never_ coalesced?
